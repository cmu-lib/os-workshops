# OSDC MiniSeries: Reproducible Research

> *All the goodness of our popular Carpentries workshops packed into shorter, bite-size portions!*

These courses were created from curriculum originally developed by [The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/). 

The aim of the OSDC MiniSeries workshops is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for conducting research in a reproducible manner. [Reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) is the idea that any result obtained by an experiment or observational study should be documented by making all data and code available in such a way that the computations can be executed again with identical results. Click [here](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/reproducibility) to learn more about research reproducibility at CMU.

Mini courses are designed to be completed within 2 to 4 hours. This abbreviated format is intended to complement the more intensive 2-3 day format of our [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/) and the 1-hour [Library workshop series](https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/workshops?cid=9148&t=g&d=0000-00-00&cal=9148&inc=0). Minis provide more modular presentations of the Carpentries curriculum and are therefore ideal for participants with more limited availability.

OSDC workshops are designed for participants with no programming experience.
