# OSDC MiniSeries: Reproducible Research

> *All the goodness of our popular Carpentries workshops packed into shorter, bite-size portions!*

These courses were created from curriculum originally developed by [The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/). 

The aim of the OSDC MiniSeries workshops is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for conducting research in a reproducible manner. [Reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) is the idea that any result obtained by an experiment or observational study should be documented by making all data and code available in such a way that the computations can be executed again with identical results. Click [here](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/reproducibility) to learn more about research reproducibility at CMU.

Mini courses are designed to be completed within 2 to 4 hours. This abbreviated format is intended to complement the more intensive 2-3 day format of our [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/) and the 1-hour [Library workshop series](https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/workshops?cid=9148&t=g&d=0000-00-00&cal=9148&inc=0). Minis provide more modular presentations of the Carpentries curriculum and are therefore ideal for participants with more limited availability.

OSDC workshops are designed for participants with no programming experience.

### Introduction to Python for Data Science

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmu-lib/os-workshops/HEAD)

<img align="left" width="40%" height="40%" src="reproducible-research/intro-to-python-for-data-science/fig/0_jupyterlab_notebook_screenshot.png"> This 3-hour course serves as an introduction to Python for non-programmers with a focus on plotting and data analysis. The first half of this course begins with a brief tour of JupyterLab, with an overview of Jupyter Notebooks, and moves to basic Python programming with data. In the second half, the course transitions into demonstrating the ways that learners can use Python libraries to read tabular data, perform statistical analyses, and visualize data.

Duration: 3 hours.
